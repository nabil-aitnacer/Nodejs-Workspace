To broadcast, we have to specify the individual socket. This lets the Socket.io library know which users shouldn't get the event. In this case, the user that we call here is not going to get the event, but everyone else will. Now, we need to call socket.broadcast:
Broadcast is an object that has its own emit function, and it's the exact same syntax as io.emit or socket.emit. The big difference is who it gets sent to. This will send the event to everybody but the mentioned socket, which means if I fire a createMessage event, the newMessage event will fire to everybody but myself, and that's exactly what we can do here.
