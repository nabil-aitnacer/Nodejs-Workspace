In order to pull off just the properties we want users to update, we're going to be using the pick method, _.pick. The pick method is fantastic; it takes an object, we're going to pass in req.body, then it takes an array of properties that you want to pull off, if they exist. For example, if the text property exists, we want to pull that off of req.body, adding it to body. This is something that users should be able to update, and we'll do the same thing for completed. These are the only two properties a user is going to be able to update; we don't need users updating IDs or adding any other properties that aren't specified in the Mongoose model
